#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/PJdIwZ98p0w>
#### Description: This code defines a class called QuadraticExpression which represents a quadratic function in standard form. The class is initialized by taking input of a quadratic expression, and it stores the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c in private variables _a, _b, and _c. The class has various methods to calculate different properties of the quadratic function, such as the discriminant, x-intercepts, y-intercept, axis of symmetry, vertex, sum of roots, product of roots, and plot of the function. The discriminant method calculates the discriminant of the quadratic function using the formula b^2-4ac. The x_intercepts method calculates the x-intercepts of the quadratic function using the quadratic formula ((-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a). The y_intercept method returns the y-intercept of the quadratic function. The axis_of_symmetry method calculates the axis of symmetry of the quadratic function using the formula -b/2a. The vertex method calculates the vertex of the quadratic function using the formula (-b/2a, f(-b/2a)). The sum_roots method calculates the sum of the roots of the quadratic function using the formula -b/a. The product_roots method calculates the product of the roots of the quadratic function using the formula c/a. The plot method plots the quadratic function using Matplotlib library. It creates a new figure and axis object, plots the quadratic function, and adds x and y-axis lines. Overall, this code provides a simple way to calculate and plot various properties of a quadratic function.
